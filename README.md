Documented steps on how to Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit.

How to Create a New Repository in Git
When you're starting a new coding project (or joining an existing one) the first thing to do is create (or clone) the project's Git repository.

How to create a Brand New Repository:

If you want to start a new coding project on your computer, there are a couple of easy steps to follow if you want to put this project under version control with Git:
#1: Create a folder for this project on your local hard drive
$ mkdir my-project

#2: change into this folder
$ cd my-project

#3: initialize a new, empty Git repository here
$ git init

...after having written some code + created some files...
#4: add all changes to the next (= first) commit
$ git add .

#5: create this first commit
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
This set of commands leaves you with a new Git repository, your first few code files already added in a first commit.
In case you are using the Tower Git client, you can simply drag and drop your project folder - and then create your first commit with a couple of simple clicks:

Cloning an Existing Repository
If you want to join an existing project that has already been started by someone else, you have to clone it. Cloning a repository from a remote server means downloading it to your computer so you can work on the project. Here's a quick overview of how to do that:
(Note: I suppose you already have an account for the corresponding code hosting platform - like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket... - and the project owner has given you access to the repository!)
#1: move to the location where you want to download the project
$ cd my-projects

#2: download the project by cloning it
$ git clone https://github.com/gittower/git-crash-course.git
You might then have to provide your authentication details - and will then have the complete project, including all of its history, on your computer and can start contributing to the project.

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
  Answer on installation of phyton programme
Step 1: Download Python
Head over to the official Python website and download the latest version of Python for Windows.
The Python website will automatically detect your operating system and suggest the best version for you to download. Make sure you choose the installer that’s compatible with Windows 11. Once you’ve clicked on the download link, the installer file will start downloading.

Step 2: Run the Installer
Locate the downloaded installer file and double-click it to run the Python installer.

You might get a security prompt asking if you’re sure you want to run the file. Click ‘Yes’ to proceed. The Python installer window will open up, presenting you with several options.
Step 3: Customize Installation (Optional)
You can choose to customize your Python installation by clicking on the ‘Customize installation’ button, or you can go with the default settings.
If you’re not sure what to do, it’s safe to stick with the default settings. However, if you’re feeling adventurous or have specific requirements, feel free to customize the installation to suit your needs.
Step 4: Begin the Installation
Click on the ‘Install Now’ button to begin the installation process.
The installer will show you the progress as Python is installed on your Windows 11 machine. Wait for the installation to complete. This might take a few minutes, so be patient.

Step 5: Verify the Installation
Once the installation is complete, you can check that Python has been installed correctly by opening the Command Prompt and typing ‘python’.
If Python is installed correctly, you will see the Python version number and a prompt where you can start typing Python code. If you don’t see this, you may need to revisit the installation steps or consult the Python documentation for troubleshooting tips.
After completing the installation, you will have a fully functional Python environment on your Windows 11 system, ready for you to start coding!
Tips for Installing Python on Windows 11
Always download Python from the official website to ensure you’re getting the legitimate version.
If you’re new to Python, stick with the default installation settings to avoid unnecessary complications.
Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process. This will make it easier to run Python from the Command Prompt.
Consider installing a Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to make coding in Python more manageable and more efficient.
Python 3 is the latest version and the one you should install, as Python 2 is no longer maintained and does not receive updates or security fixes.

2. You can install an interpreter when you install the Python workload, or you can install an interpreter after a workload is present. Interpreters can also be installed manually outside of the Visual Studio Installer.
When you install the Python development workload in Visual Studio 2017 and later, Python 3 (64-bit) also installs by default. As an option, you can choose to install the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Python 2 or Python 3, along with Miniconda (Visual Studio 2019) or Anaconda 2/Anaconda 3 (Visual Studio 2017). The steps for this type of installation are described in Install Python support in Visual Studio.

There are several options for installing Python interpreters to work with Visual Studio. You can install an interpreter when you install the Python workload, or you can install an interpreter after a workload is present. Interpreters can also be installed manually outside of the Visual Studio Installer.
When you install the Python development workload in Visual Studio 2017 and later, Python 3 (64-bit) also installs by default. As an option, you can choose to install the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Python 2 or Python 3, along with Miniconda (Visual Studio 2019) or Anaconda 2/Anaconda 3 (Visual Studio 2017). The steps for this type of installation are described in Install Python support in Visual Studio.
An alternate approach is to install standard Python interpreters by using the Add Environment feature in Visual Studio. This option is available in the Python Environments window and the Python toolbar.
Python interpreters can also be installed manually outside of the Visual Studio Installer. Suppose you install Anaconda 3 before you install Visual Studio. You don't need to reinstall Anaconda through the Visual Studio Installer. You can also install a newer version of an interpreter if it isn't yet listed in the Visual Studio Installer.

CPython
The "native" and most commonly used interpreter, available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions (32-bit recommended). Includes the latest language features, maximum Python package compatibility, full debugging support, and interop with IPython. Review the considerations in Should I use Python 2 or Python 3? to help determine which version of Python to install.
Visual Studio 2015 and earlier don't support Python 3.6 or later, and can return errors like Unsupported python version 3.6. For Visual Studio 2015 and earlier, use Python 3.5 or earlier.
IronPython
A .NET implementation of Python, available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Provides C#/F#/Visual Basic interop, access to .NET APIs, standard Python debugging (but not C++ mixed-mode debugging), and mixed IronPython/C# debugging.
IronPython doesn't support virtual environments.
Anaconda
An open data science platform powered by Python. Includes the latest version of CPython and most of the difficult-to-install packages.
If you're unable to decide on an interpreter, we recommend using Anaconda.
PyPy
A high-performance tracing JIT implementation of Python. Good for long-running programs and situations where you identify performance issues but can't find other resolutions.
Works with Visual Studio but with limited support for advanced debugging features.
Jython etc.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

First things first: we need to install pip itself. The good news is that Pip is probably already present in your system. Most Python installers also install Pip. Python’s pip is already installed if you use Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org. If you work in a virtual environment, pip also gets installed.
So before you try to install Pip, ensure it’s not already on your system. Open a terminal (Linux/MacOS) or a Windows shell, and type in the following command:
pip help
If the pip command gives an error, try pip3 instead. Python 2 and 3 can be installed next to each other on some systems. On those systems, pip is often installed under the name pip3:
pip3 help
If that didn’t work either, you can try the pip module that is built into most modern Python installations:
python3 -m pip help
If that failed, too, you need to install it yourself, so let’s take a look at how to do so manually. You should do this only as a last resort, and I strongly suggest you first check if your Python installation went well.
Install Pip on Windows and Mac
On Windows and Mac, you can download a Python script to install pip, called get-pip.py. Download the file and run it with Python from a command prompt or terminal window.

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

How to Install a MySQL Database on Windows
The installation process of the MySQL database is simple. The first step is to download MySQL Community Server. When you load the page, you’ll see something like the screenshot below.
 
From Select Operating System, choose your OS (Microsoft Windows). You can choose ZIP Archive or Installer MSI; I recommend the second option because it is easier to configure the server.To install the installer, click the Go to Download Page button for the MSI installer. You can choose between two kinds of installations: the smaller installer downloads the needed source during the installation process, while the bigger installer contains all the needed files. I recommend the larger installer:
 
Click the Download button. You will be asked for login or signup info, but you can just click the No thanks just start my download link and carry on.
 
The file will start downloading; when it’s ready, run the installer.
 
The installation wizard appears and lets you choose the setup type. Custom allows you to manually select the products you want to install, such as MySQL Shell, connectors, IDE (integrated development environment), etc. The Full setup type installs all available products and features. Sometimes there is a problem with installing one of the products; in that case, you can choose Custom setup type and omit the problem product.
The Server Only option installs MySQL server without client applications or connectors; the Client Only installs only client products (like applications and connectors) without the server. Finally, Developer Default lets you install MySQL server on dedicated or development machines.
I’m going to choose the custom installation option so I can walk you through the database server and all its client products.
 
The arrows let you select or delete the products to be installed (listed on the right).
 
Once you’ve decided what to install, click the Next button. You’ll see a list of selected features to install.
 
Click the Next button if you don’t need any changes.
Another screen confirms the products to be installed. If everything looks good,
approve them by clicking the Next button.
 
If you agree with selected packages to install, click Execute.
 
Click the Next button again if everything looks good. In the wizard, you will see information about the configuration process.
 
The next steps configure installed products, so click the Next button to configure the settings. One of the default settings is Port 3306 for the MySQL server.
 
In the Authentication Method, allowing Use of Strong Passwords is recommended.
 
Click the Next button.
In Account and Roles, write the password for the admin user in the MySQL server called root. You can also add another user to the MySQL database. To do this, click the Add User button.
 
In the dialog window, enter the user name; you can also change the host or allow the user to connect to all hosts (the default setting). Don’t forget to give the user a password.
 
Accept the settings by clicking the OK button.
In the wizard, you will see the new record for the user you just added.
 
Click Next.
The next step configures MySQL Server as a Window service; click the Next button to accept this service.
 
In this part of the installation, you will see a list of steps to make certain changes. Apply them by clicking the Execute button.
 
At the end of the configuration, click the Finish button.
 
The next part of the installation starts with the configuration of MySQL products. I’ll leave it with the default settings.
 
Click the Next button and then the Finish button.
  
In Connect to Server, enter the user as root and the password you selected for the root user. Click the Check button to test the connection.
  
If a green checkmark appears, the connection is good; click the Next button.
In Apply Configuration, click the Execute button.
 
Wait for the configuration to complete and click the Finish button.
 
Click the Next button again.
 
When the installation process is done, you will see Installation Complete in the wizard. Click the Finish button.
 
The MySQL Workbench editor and MySQL Shell will appear on your screen.
Congratulations! You’ve just installed MySQL 8!
Setting Up Scripting Environments for a MySQL Database
Using the MYSQL Workbench Editor
Installing a MySQL database on  your PC also gives you the MySQL Workbench editor and command-line tools for writing a SQL script. Note: You can run MySQL Workbench off the Windows Start menu; expand MySQL and select MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE. The screenshot below will show you this editor.
 
If you would like to connect to a server, double click the Local instance MySQL connection.
The dialog window appears:
 
Enter the password for root – you can opt to save this information if you like. Click the OK button to apply it.
In the Navigator window, you can click on the sample database, expand it, select the Tables node, expand it, and click on the table icon. In the query window, you’ll see some code that will select all the data from this table. You can see this below:
 
Of course, you can create your database and its tables and use them later.
Using the MySQL Shell Command Line
If you prefer writing scripts using a command-line tool, try MySQL Shell. Open the Start menu, expand the MySQL node, and click on MySQL Shell. This is what you’ll see:
 
By default, it opens in JS mode. You can change it to SQL by writing this command:
\sql
Next, connect to the MySQL server by writing this command:
\connect
Then enter the user name, the ‘@’ sign, the host name, and ‘:’. On my computer, I use root (the default admin user) and localhost (the default for your computer) as a host.
Press Enter, then submit the password for that user:
 
Now you are ready to write SQL commands to your MySQL database.
In my opinion, both MySQL Workbench and MySQL Shell are very good editors for beginners and you don’t need to install them separately. 


7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.


Tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Microsoft use containers in their streamlined processes to facilitate a secure and easy deployment into the cloud production environments. This deployment with containers offers a technique, that abstracts the application from the run-time environment offered by virtualization. The two core concepts to be explored here are:
How are containers built on the virtualization technique?
How do they offer an alternative to virtual machines?
1. How Containers Are Built Using Virtualization Technology?
To answer how containers enable virtualization let us discuss in detail what is virtualization and how containers come into play with this concept. Virtualization is a technique, which essentially creates an illusion of a resource such as a desktop, storage, network, or operating system. Devices, applications, and human users possess the capability of interacting with these resources. This illusion also called virtualization expands the capabilities of traditional systems, which are limited by their own physical resources. Now, containers enable this virtualization for applications that are deployed in them. Applications in containers run independently, isolated from any physical resource. Containers virtualize the OS, CPU, memory, storage, and network resources thereby providing a controlled environment that can be scaled up or down as required. A container also packages the application along with its dependencies and necessary files, which enables the application to be deployed on any environment without having to configure the server, hardware or software This still sounds similar to virtualization implemented through virtual machines right? So before we get into what more containers can do let us clear up how containers differ from virtual machines



2. How do They Offer An Alternative To Virtual Machines?
A Virtual machine is a form of hardware virtualization. The hardware is logically separated from the other resources. The hardware can be any system such as a desktop (with hardware and its own OS) called the host machine, on which several virtual machines or guest machines can run, each with their own separate operating systems. This is made possible by a firmware called the hypervisor.

Containers like virtual machines, run on a host machine. They can also be controlled as needed and provide isolation of applications from the run-time environment. However, containers aim at operating system virtualization. Unlike virtual machines, in a containerized system guest operating systems need not be installed on the host system. Instead, the underlying host operating system is shared by all instances of containers containing the application code. This makes containers lightweight and reduces operating system overheads associated with virtual machines such as patching, upgrading, driver support, etc. Moreover, it reduces the amount of resources of the host machine consumed by the presence of individual operating systems.


What Is The Difference Between A Docker And A Virtual Machine(VM)?
The following are the main differences between a Docker and a VM:
Aspect
Docker
Virtual Machine ( VM )
Isolation
Docker comes with light weight platform, 
It uses containerization for Isolation environments.
Virtual Machines comes with heavy software provides full virtualization for Complete OS Isolation.
Resources Usage
It consumes less resources from Host OS kernel and use them more efficiently
VM are less efficient in using of resources effectively, each VM uses it own OS kernel and consumes more resources.
Start Time
These are faster in setting up the OS platforms( containers), typically in seconds.
These are slower in startup time often requires minutes to setup the Instances.
 
Scalability
Scaling of containers in docker is easy , it comes with less footprints.
It will be resource intensive when scaling of instances.
Portability
Docker provides containerized applications that are high portable, consistent across different environments.
These are also portable but it will be heavier due to its encapsulation of the entire OS.
Use Case
It will be effective for microservices, lightweight applications and containerized environments.
It suitable for running multiple applications in different environments.
Similarities Between Docker And VM
The following are the main similarities between Docker and a Virtual Machine:
Isolation Environments: Both Docker and Virtual Machines provide some extent of isolation for the applications. Docker achieves isolation through containerization on isolating the processes whereas VM achieves full virtualizing as two entirely separate operating systems.
Portability Of Applications: Portability of applications can be possible on both the docker and virtual machines to run the applications consistently across various different platforms. Docker provides docker images and VM provides encapsulating the entire virtualized OS, enabling easy migration between various platforms.
Snapshot And Versioning: Snapshot and Versioning are supported in both platforms allowing users to capture the current state of an application at a specific point in time. It is useful for creating backups, testing, and versioning and provides an effective way of reverting to a specific known state.
Resource Management: Both Technologies provide an efficient resource management. Both facilitate with allocation of specific resources such as CPU, memory and storage ensuring that applications run with necessary resources without any interference from each other.
Benefits Of Containers
Applications can be deployed without any worry about the run time environment. As a result, an application can easily be moved through the software development cycle and can run anywhere, for example, on Mac OS, Linux, Windows, and even in data centers. This results in less expenditure of time on examining the environment and more time can be time on developing new functionality.
Multiple containers with applications can be run on the same instance of physical resource sharing an operating system. These containers being lightweight are fast and efficiently utilize the computing resources available.
Containers are isolated from one another, which gives the developer the leeway to split application services into different containers. These containers do not share any dependencies and each can be manipulated and updated by the developer at will.
Containers come with the inbuilt capability of version control.
Benefits Of Virtual Machines
Isolation And Security: VMs provide strong isolation by running the applications on fully virtual Separate Operating Systems on a single physical machine. Isolation provides security for the applications in the environments.
Versatility And Compatibility: VM comes with supporting various operating systems allowing for a wide range of applications to run on the same physical hardware. Its versatility makes it suitable for hosting multiple applications as per their specified environments.
Snapshots And Rollbacks: Virtual machines facilitate taking snapshots and capturing the complete state of the VM at a specific point in time. It provides the facility for the users to roll back their known and required states in case of updates or any issues.
Resource Optimization: Virtualization provides efficient allocation and utilization of resources providing dynamic configuration of hardware resources such as RAM, CPU, and Storage for specific amounts. Its flexibility enhances resource management and scalability in virtualized environments.
When to Use: Docker Vs Virtual Machine
1. Use The Docker In The Following Cases
Lightweight Isolation Is Sufficient: Docker is effective in situations where lightweight process isolation is sufficient. It is effective in usage with microservices architectures and for efficient containerized applications with minimal overhead.
Fast Deployment And Scaling: Docker containers will start the applications quickly, making them suitable for dynamic environments that require rapid deployment and scaling.
Consistent Development And Deployment: Docker provides consistency between development and deployment environments for applications. It ensures that applications behave in the same way across different stages of the development lifecycle.
2. Use The Virtual Machines In The Following Cases
Fully Operating System Isolation Is Required: If your application needs complete isolation as separate operating systems, then Virtual Machines are the preferable choice. VM provides a stronger isolation, making it suitable for applications to run on diverse OS requirements.
Legacy Applications And Compatability: VMs are preferable for hosting legacy type of applications that can’t be containerized easily. They support a wide range of Operating Systems making the applications compatible with specific OS versions and configurations.
Resource-Intensive Workloads: VM can be used in scenarios where there is a need for intensive computations for workloads, we can go for VM for having granular control over the resource allocations and making them better suited for the cases.
Conclusion
In conclusion, container usage enhances the virtualization technology for creating a light weighted, portable software applications for deployments. Containers share the host operating system to reduce the resources overhead and improve the efficiency of virtual computers. Container platforms like Docker provide the advantage of scaling, rapid deployment, and maintaining uniform development. It facilitates well in customizing the dynamic and lightweight providing strong isolation and support for different types of OS systems.

While i was setting up my sql environment i faced a lot of difficulties, i had to watch several videos to understand and implement the steps learnt from those videos to setup my sql. After successful completion of setting up my sql, i had to start by configuring to start a new task.
I can say the remaning set up was easy for me, especially setting up and downloading my visual studio code, python and github. because i already have a residual knowledge on these processes.
